Bunch of stuff for setting up my mac

```
curl -fsSL https://git.io/pwaego | bash
```

# Steps that are still manual

## Before Starting

* Confirm logged into iCloud account
* Open App Store and Sign in (not sure why it's a separate step!)

## After Finishing
* All the damn permission dialogs for access to Downloads, Documents, etc
  * Click OK as they appear at times
* Enable SteelSeries Engine Module
  * On your Mac, try checking System Preferences > Security & Privacy > Privacy > Input Monitoring > add permission for SteelSeries Engine
*
